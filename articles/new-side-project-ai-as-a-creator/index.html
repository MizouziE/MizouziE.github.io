  <section class="page-section"><p><a href="https://ai-as-a-creator.github.io"><img src="/images/ai-as-a-creator-homepage.png" alt="The landing page for the project"></a></p>
<p>I am excited to announce the launch of a side-project that acts as a sort of recycling plant for the content I will be generating over the course of a current work project. It will be like a document to what I learn about interacting with the machine learning language model <em>Davinci</em> from OpenAI and the image generating model from Midjourney.</p>
<p>I was really taken aback by the abilities of these tools, much like everyone else that have tried them, and when I was told that I would get free reign to try out the language model and build something off the back of it I was excited to say the least.</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
<p>The project itself I have named <strong>AI as a Creator</strong> and you can view the <a href="https://ai-as-a-creator.github.io">site here</a>. The purpose of it is simply to show what comes out from the various prompts and re-tweaked prompts that I will be using while working with the model and also whatever images are produced when I go and have some fun with Midjourney.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of the static site generator <a href="gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and have used that to start this site with the help of a theme by <a href="https://www.janraasch.com/">Jan Raasch</a> who I should probably apologise to because I removed the little &ldquo;made with ♥ by Jan Raasch&rdquo; from the footer because I couldn&rsquo;t stand how it looked 🙈 I do, however, have it written down several times in my notes that if this even generates any revenue then I promise to pay a fair percentage towards their company.</p>
<h3 id="the-past">The past</h3>
<p>The job that churns out the bi-product that I am to turn into this project has me writing an application in Go, which is fast becoming my second favourite language after SQL. As I am making small tweaks here and there I need to constantly test that the application behaves as expected and that involves interacting with the OpenAI API, which has a <strong>very</strong> nice library for use with Go and I must mention that it has been one of the most painless, if not one of the most down-right enjoyable experiences I&rsquo;ve had since I began developing.</p>
<p>It has been surprisingly inexpensive to use too. The table below shows some of my whole team&rsquo;s usage and even the biggest spike on the 10th of February where we tried to push the limits to see where the ceiling was ended up only costing $0.23 which is almost nothing!</p>
<p><img src="/images/openai-daily-usage.png" alt="Daily usage chart"></p>
<h3 id="the-present">The present</h3>
<p>The site itself is <em>mostly</em> a single page kind of thing, but there are a couple of supplementary pages for the moment that just provide a little extra context if desired.</p>
<p>There is not a huge amount of content thus far, but I thought it was enough to make a start. It was also a great excuse for me to practice my front end abilities even just in the realms of HTML, CSS and minimal JS. As a predominantly back end developer, I need to seize every opportunity I get! That mixed with my undeniable soft-spot for the arts meant that I just couldn&rsquo;t sit on this pile of genuine creativity, it had to be shared.</p>
<p>It is a collection of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories</li>
<li>Poems</li>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Jokes</li>
<li>Instructions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>I plan to keep on adding to it as the content piles up in my own computer, hoping that the quality of it also improves along the way even if I do already think the very first things I&rsquo;ve generated are amazing to some degree.</p>
<p>The site will definitely be a rolling project and I already keep a notepad where I can scribble down ideas as they come to me. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of the entries should have a button at the bottom or the side that <em>reveal</em> the prompt that was used to generate that particular piece.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each entry should have a button to share <strong>just</strong> that entry, perhaps meaning that I will have to create an individual page for each entry and just display them all as one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The possibilities are quite exciting and having a seemingly endless stream of content really takes the pressure off from having to write it like I write the articles on this site. I hope to explore and learn a great deal in terms of design, UI and UX.</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea what the ultimate outcome will be. I&rsquo;m certainly not holding my breath for any monetary gains as this is purely an artistic endevour and I&rsquo;m already very happy with the things I&rsquo;ve learnt about front end development just in these first two days.</p>
<p>But that is exactly it&hellip; It&rsquo;s just the first two days, so there couldn&rsquo;t possibly be any way to tell what comes of this. All I can hope is that someone out there finds what has been produced as interesting and enjoyable as I do and will make my sharing it worthwhile.</p>
<p>Go take a look and bookmark the page so you can check in after a while and see where this journey has taken the project. Or better yet, share this post with someone that <strong>you</strong> think would really enjoy what is on show.</p>
