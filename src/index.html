            <h1>
                This is the header, it will include:
            </h1>
            <li>A moving title</li>
            <li>Some quick links to repos/projects</li>
            <li>Eventually, a search bar</li>
            <li>Toggle for light/dark theme</li>
        </ul>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h1>What's the point?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The whole point of this is to force me to be comfortable coding in front of others. So many developers experience some form of "imposter syndrome" and I'm no exception. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I figure, if I do this, in this way, I'll be more comfortable much quicker and therefore more productive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Please bear in mind that I am a PHP/Laravel developer first, so my actual abilities are probably beyond what I have on display here, being restricted to HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Here we'll have:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"About Me" section</li>
                <li>More detailed description of what I have worked on</li>
                <li>What I'm currently working on</li>
                <li>CSS art appreciation, eventually my own rendition</li>
                <!-- <li></li>
                <li></li> -->
            </ul>

            <h2>What I want to include in all this:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The about me section needs to clearly show that I like PHP development more regarding actual content</li>
                <li>However, that section needs to have cool feature (NOTE: not necessarily useful, just cool) to show examples of my ability to actually code</li>
                <li>Custom-ish JavaScript functionality that makes the section more than "Read-only"</li>
                <li>Also some kind of scroll induce animation would be very nice</li>
                <li>Styling, of course, needs to be on point and I'll likely implement tailwindCSS for this cos I like working with it</li>
                <li>Write a nice solution for light/dark theme switching</li>
                <li>Some incorporation of an API call just to show I can do it</li>
                <li>A display of my 3 most recent tweets</li>
                <li>Direct email form and submition so users can leave any comments or suggestions. Input is ALWAYS welcome!</li>
            </ul>
