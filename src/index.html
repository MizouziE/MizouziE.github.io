                This is the header, it will include:
            </h1>
            <li>A moving title</li>
            <li>Some quick links to repos/projects</li>

    <main>
        <section class="my-4" >
            <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">What's the point?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The whole point of this is to force me to be comfortable coding in front of others. So many
                    developers experience some form of "imposter syndrome" and I'm no exception.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I figure, if I do this, in this way, I'll be more comfortable much quicker and therefore more
                    productive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Please bear in mind that I am a PHP/Laravel developer first, so my actual abilities are probably
                    beyond what I have on display here, being restricted to HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                </p>
            </div class="flex my-2">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Here we'll have:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"About Me" section</li>
                <li>More detailed description of what I have worked on</li>
                <li>What I'm currently working on</li>
                <li>CSS art appreciation, eventually my own rendition</li>

                <li></li> -->
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What I want to include in all this:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The about me section needs to clearly show that I like PHP development more regarding actual content
                </li>
                <li>However, that section needs to have cool feature (NOTE: not necessarily useful, just cool) to show
                    examples of my ability to actually code</li>
                <li>Custom-ish JavaScript functionality that makes the section more than "Read-only"</li>
                <li>Also some kind of scroll induce animation would be very nice</li>
                <li>Styling, of course, needs to be on point and I'll likely implement tailwindCSS for this cos I like
                    working with it</li>
                <li>Write a nice solution for light/dark theme switching</li>
                <li>Some incorporation of an API call just to show I can do it</li>
                <li>A display of my 3 most recent tweets</li>
                <li>Direct email form and submition so users can leave any comments or suggestions. Input is ALWAYS
                    welcome!</li>
            </ul>
