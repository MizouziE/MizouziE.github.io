      <description>Energy Price News API 
A project to create a public API that scrapes news sites for anything concerning the changes in energy prices.
This project&amp;rsquo;s secondary aim is to help beginners learn how to contribute to open source projects and will be purposely kept as basic as possible.

All his games are simple, noisy and colourful. I found a nice tutorial on Laracasts that showed how to make a Wordle clone on the popular (and my favourite) framework Laravel, but after follwoing along I realised that the whole framework was unnecessary.</description>
