      <description>I am excited to announce the launch of a side-project that acts as a sort of recycling plant for the content I will be generating over the course of a current work project. It will be like a document to what I learn about interacting with the machine learning language model Davinci from OpenAI and the image generating model from Midjourney.
I was really taken aback by the abilities of these tools, much like everyone else that have tried them, and when I was told that I would get free reign to try out the language model and build something off the back of it I was excited to say the least.</description>

      <title>Why I won&#39;t use AI on this blog</title>

      <description>Where I won&amp;rsquo;t use AI As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already spotted, the image for this article is, in fact, an AI generated image. I will go into detail about the image itself later in this post, but I want to assure you that I am not trying to pull the wool over your eyes!
What I mean when I say that I won&amp;rsquo;t use artificial intelligence is that I will not use it for any of the written content that you will find here in this blog.</description>
