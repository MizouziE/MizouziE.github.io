      <description>I am excited to announce the launch of a side-project that acts as a sort of recycling plant for the content I will be generating over the course of a current work project. It will be like a document to what I learn about interacting with the machine learning language model Davinci from OpenAI and the image generating model from Midjourney.
I was really taken aback by the abilities of these tools, much like everyone else that have tried them, and when I was told that I would get free reign to try out the language model and build something off the back of it I was excited to say the least.</description>
