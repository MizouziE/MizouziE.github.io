      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a year now working as part of a development team with PHP and Laravel. Before I was ever involved, the project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked most on was already running and comprised of a RESTful API, a CMS and umpteen instances of frontend applications that showed all the wonderfully managed data to the end users.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent a few hours a day working here and there with the various code bases, I&amp;rsquo;ve only very recently felt like I know the ins and outs of how it works and that is thanks to having been given the task of writing the documentation for the whole thing.</description>
