      <description>Senior Developers A senior developer has earned that title. They&amp;rsquo;ve waged wars and won, faced long days and nights, overcome the most obscure of obstacles. Now, for all their troubles they have to deal with you. Wet behind the ears and a danger if left unmonitored. Hardly seems fair, does it?

      <description>What is Laravel Tinker? The short answer is that it&amp;rsquo;s a super power they give you when you boot up your Laravel application. All you type into the terminal:
./artisan tinker OR EVEN... ./artisan tink This command boots up the built in REPL that is based on PsySH. REPL stands for; Read the user input, Evaluate the input, Print the resulting output and Loop back again to await further input. What kind of input and what kind of output though?</description>
