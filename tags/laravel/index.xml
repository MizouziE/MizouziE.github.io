      <description>Formkit is a supercharger for developing applications on the already turbo platform of Laravel Inertia with Vue 3. It is a library of ready made components for building forms that make it very easy to construct any kind of form for retrieving user input. One of the features of this library that stood out the most for me was the Multi-Step forms.
Multi-Step Forms So what is a multi-step form?</description>

      <description>What is Laravel Tinker? The short answer is that it&amp;rsquo;s a super power they give you when you boot up your Laravel application. All you type into the terminal:
./artisan tinker OR EVEN... ./artisan tink This command boots up the built in REPL that is based on PsySH. REPL stands for; Read the user input, Evaluate the input, Print the resulting output and Loop back again to await further input. What kind of input and what kind of output though?</description>

      <description>I have learnt a lot in the last few weeks and it was thanks to taking on a personal project that was a vastly scaled down version of what I have been working with this past year. What I have learnt was not necessarily fresh knowledge, but more an understanding that had previously evaded me. The reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood a lot of the concepts I was facing was because I had not built the original codebase to the original specs, I was just introduced to it in small sections and asked to work on individual features.</description>

      <title>Heroku vs Laravel (vs me...)</title>

      <description>The first time I attempted to deploy a Laravel project onto the popular hosting service Heroku I did not get very far. I found a number of helpful tutorials just with a few google searches, but none of them actually got me across the finish line. It was my first actual attempt at &amp;ldquo;going live&amp;rdquo; and the whole thing left me somewhat bemused and painfully aware of my lack of understanding.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m glad I used QuickAdminPanel today</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Laravel and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly familiar with Livewire and AlpineJS, so by rights I should be fine building admin panels from scratch with the tools provided by this framework and packages. In theory. In reality, for me, even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a total beginner it&amp;rsquo;d take me over an hour to build it properly and then another hour to get it all working properly with model relationships, views, components and routes all doing what they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to.</description>
