What is Docker Docker is a tool used to create what are known as containers, yes you can imagine it like a shipping container on a cargo ship (hence the company&amp;rsquo;s logo/mascot, Moby). The containers themselves are like small virtual machines that run a specific package of software that is defined by something called an image. The image tells Docker exactly what the small virtual machine needs to be and do and Docker creates a software only version of exactly that which runs on your host machine but still completely separate from your machine.</description>

      <description>When I first started writing about the things I was doing while learning how to code, I honestly don’t think I had any particular future plans in mind. I’d read various sources on the web and saw that it could be beneficial in finding a job, and even though I didn’t necessarily believe it would make a huge difference, I did it anyway. Over the first few months I wrote 9 articles covering the things that stuck out the most for me at the time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a year now working as part of a development team with PHP and Laravel. Before I was ever involved, the project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked most on was already running and comprised of a RESTful API, a CMS and umpteen instances of frontend applications that showed all the wonderfully managed data to the end users.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent a few hours a day working here and there with the various code bases, I&amp;rsquo;ve only very recently felt like I know the ins and outs of how it works and that is thanks to having been given the task of writing the documentation for the whole thing.</description>

      <description>I have learnt a lot in the last few weeks and it was thanks to taking on a personal project that was a vastly scaled down version of what I have been working with this past year. What I have learnt was not necessarily fresh knowledge, but more an understanding that had previously evaded me. The reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood a lot of the concepts I was facing was because I had not built the original codebase to the original specs, I was just introduced to it in small sections and asked to work on individual features.</description>

      <title>My Top 3 Benefits of Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>You simply cannot be in web or software development and not have heard of Open Source Software. In case your computer/laptop/phone somehow has no internet connection, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of software written by a group of developers in the public domain that can potentially accept help from anyone, anywhere. A beautifully utopian idea with roots as far back as the 60&amp;rsquo;s that has flourished over the last few decades as the world became more tech-dependant and interconnected.</description>

      <description>Enkle Word Game A copy of the popular word puzzle game Wordle made with JavaScript and hosted on a static site.
Click here to play! The idea Seeing that my young son was able to stare at his tablet screen for hours if not interupted, I wanted to make something to at least give him some sort of lesson while he played. All his games are simple, noisy and colourful. I found a nice tutorial on Laracasts that showed how to make a Wordle clone on the popular (and my favourite) framework Laravel, but after follwoing along I realised that the whole framework was unnecessary.</description>
