      <description>Introduction I had a task a few months back of discovering the cause of a bug in a production environment that just was not presenting itself in development, mostly due to the creators and users of the application having ever so slightly differing ideas about how the app should be used. This meant that in all of our testing while making the application, we never saw the bug that was being reported.</description>

      <title>How to test protected functions with PHPUnit in your Laravel app</title>

      <description>Typical places this arises Building an application in PHP with Laravel means that we can call on a great number of classes to do various parts of the overall process we wish to achieve. For the purposes of this example (and where I first came across this issue) we will look at writing tests for a Job Class. A job class is one which will be sent some data and then process that data in the background via a worker so that the application is free to continue processing other commands.</description>

      <title>Space is the Place: Reasons to explore Twitter Spaces</title>

      <description>What are Spaces? Since the end of 2020, Twitter Spaces have been a feature of the social media platform, and while they&amp;rsquo;ve seen great popularity in some cases, some Tweeple may still not be making the most of the multitude of opportunities they can present.
The easiest way to describe them is to liken them to a hybrid of a public speaking forum at an international airport lounge in the guise of a podcast.</description>

      <title>3 things the best senior developers do</title>

      <description>Senior Developers A senior developer has earned that title. They&amp;rsquo;ve waged wars and won, faced long days and nights, overcome the most obscure of obstacles. Now, for all their troubles they have to deal with you. Wet behind the ears and a danger if left unmonitored. Hardly seems fair, does it?
This is the curse of such a vast wealth of knowledge. They&amp;rsquo;ve built up so much over the years they can&amp;rsquo;t possibly apply it all at the same time.</description>

      <title>Common Function Comparisons in PHP</title>

      <description>PHP Functions PHP is an arsenal of tools that can process data in a multitude of ways. This is one of the reasons that it powers ~75% of website server-side code. It is fast, has huge support and scales very well.
If you were to investigate how many core functions PHP has on v8.1.2 you would find:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; $funcs = get_defined_functions(); =&amp;gt; [ &amp;#34;internal&amp;#34; =&amp;gt; [ &amp;#34;zend_version&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;func_num_args&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;func_get_arg&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;func_get_args&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;strlen&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;strcmp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;strncmp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;strcasecmp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;strncasecmp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;error_reporting&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;define&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;defined&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_class&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_called_class&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_parent_class&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;is_subclass_of&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;is_a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_class_vars&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_object_vars&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_mangled_object_vars&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;get_class_methods&amp;#34;, : &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; echo count($funcs[&amp;#39;internal&amp;#39;]); =&amp;gt; 1735 That is not a small amount by any means, so it is impossible to know them all.</description>

      <title>3 ways to read input with a Go CLI</title>
      <link>https://www.mizouzie.dev/articles/3-ways-to-read-input-with-go-cli/</link>

      <description>Go, or Golang, is a wonderfully simple and robust language for building back end and data processing applications. In order to process data, we will need to know how to read data. Here are 3 different ways to achieve that before your application gets to crunching bytes.
Packages Go is a modular language with a strong standard library. We&amp;rsquo;ll remain inside the realms of standard and still have a comfortable amount of options.</description>

      <title>Why use Docker for databases and how</title>

      <description>Sections
What is Docker Docker is a tool used to create what are known as containers, yes you can imagine it like a shipping container on a cargo ship (hence the company&amp;rsquo;s logo/mascot, Moby). The containers themselves are like small virtual machines that run a specific package of software that is defined by something called an image. The image tells Docker exactly what the small virtual machine needs to be and do and Docker creates a software only version of exactly that which runs on your host machine but still completely separate from your machine.</description>

      <description>When I first started writing about the things I was doing while learning how to code, I honestly don’t think I had any particular future plans in mind. I’d read various sources on the web and saw that it could be beneficial in finding a job, and even though I didn’t necessarily believe it would make a huge difference, I did it anyway. Over the first few months I wrote 9 articles covering the things that stuck out the most for me at the time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a year now working as part of a development team with PHP and Laravel. Before I was ever involved, the project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked most on was already running and comprised of a RESTful API, a CMS and umpteen instances of frontend applications that showed all the wonderfully managed data to the end users.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent a few hours a day working here and there with the various code bases, I&amp;rsquo;ve only very recently felt like I know the ins and outs of how it works and that is thanks to having been given the task of writing the documentation for the whole thing.</description>

      <title>If it doesn&#39;t make sense, build a little version</title>

      <description>I have learnt a lot in the last few weeks and it was thanks to taking on a personal project that was a vastly scaled down version of what I have been working with this past year. What I have learnt was not necessarily fresh knowledge, but more an understanding that had previously evaded me. The reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood a lot of the concepts I was facing was because I had not built the original codebase to the original specs, I was just introduced to it in small sections and asked to work on individual features.</description>

      <title>My Top 3 Benefits of Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>You simply cannot be in web or software development and not have heard of Open Source Software. In case your computer/laptop/phone somehow has no internet connection, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of software written by a group of developers in the public domain that can potentially accept help from anyone, anywhere. A beautifully utopian idea with roots as far back as the 60&amp;rsquo;s that has flourished over the last few decades as the world became more tech-dependant and interconnected.</description>

      <description>Enkle Word Game A copy of the popular word puzzle game Wordle made with JavaScript and hosted on a static site.
Click here to play! The idea Seeing that my young son was able to stare at his tablet screen for hours if not interupted, I wanted to make something to at least give him some sort of lesson while he played. All his games are simple, noisy and colourful. I found a nice tutorial on Laracasts that showed how to make a Wordle clone on the popular (and my favourite) framework Laravel, but after follwoing along I realised that the whole framework was unnecessary.</description>
