      <description>The Problem Working on an open source project is one of the best things a developer can do. The opportunities to learn and network are huge compared working on solo projects. The only way I can think of getting even more out of open source than contributing is to actually create and manage a project yourself. I tried this, early on in my career in tech and it was like strapping two great big rockets to my back.</description>

      <description>Energy Price News API 
A project to create a public API that scrapes news sites for anything concerning the changes in energy prices.
This project&amp;rsquo;s secondary aim is to help beginners learn how to contribute to open source projects and will be purposely kept as basic as possible.

      <description>Enkle Word Game A copy of the popular word puzzle game Wordle made with JavaScript and hosted on a static site.
Click here to play! The idea Seeing that my young son was able to stare at his tablet screen for hours if not interupted, I wanted to make something to at least give him some sort of lesson while he played. All his games are simple, noisy and colourful. I found a nice tutorial on Laracasts that showed how to make a Wordle clone on the popular (and my favourite) framework Laravel, but after follwoing along I realised that the whole framework was unnecessary.</description>
