What is Docker Docker is a tool used to create what are known as containers, yes you can imagine it like a shipping container on a cargo ship (hence the company&amp;rsquo;s logo/mascot, Moby). The containers themselves are like small virtual machines that run a specific package of software that is defined by something called an image. The image tells Docker exactly what the small virtual machine needs to be and do and Docker creates a software only version of exactly that which runs on your host machine but still completely separate from your machine.</description>
