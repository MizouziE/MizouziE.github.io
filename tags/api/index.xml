      <description>I have learnt a lot in the last few weeks and it was thanks to taking on a personal project that was a vastly scaled down version of what I have been working with this past year. What I have learnt was not necessarily fresh knowledge, but more an understanding that had previously evaded me. The reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood a lot of the concepts I was facing was because I had not built the original codebase to the original specs, I was just introduced to it in small sections and asked to work on individual features.</description>

      <description>Energy Price News API 
A project to create a public API that scrapes news sites for anything concerning the changes in energy prices.
This project&amp;rsquo;s secondary aim is to help beginners learn how to contribute to open source projects and will be purposely kept as basic as possible.
Up to date version hosted at: RapidAPI Hub
